# Maze-Online

It all began when I saw a maze online claiming it was the largest maze on the internet. "Nonsense!" I exclaimed, I can generate a larger one. Upon looking into the eyes of the maze gods, I learned their secrets. I now had the tools I needed to generate the world's largest maze.

It wasn't enough for me to have generated the world's largest maze. The a-maze-ingness had to be shared with others. Thus, the Maze-Online (MMO) project was born. My hope is to develop this project into a large multiplayer online maze where the goal is to collect resources and make it to the exit.
